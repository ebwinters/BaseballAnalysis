Some questions I want to answer using the baseball data:

1. Are height and weight correlated with homeruns over their career (in the regular season)?
  a. Make a scatter plot with height and weight as the axis the points being sized appropriately for homeruns
  b. Use ML to make predictions on how many homeruns player will hit later on

2. If you are on X team, how likely are you to be hit by a pitch?
  a. Graph bar chart with teams as x axis and likelyhood to be hit on y axis
