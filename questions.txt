Some questions I want to answer using the baseball data:

1. Are height and weight correlated with homeruns over their career (in the regular season)?
  a. Make a scatter plot with height and weight as the axis the points being sized appropriately for homeruns
  b. Use ML to make predictions on how many homeruns player will hit later on

2. If you are on X team, how likely are you to be hit by a pitch?
  a. Graph bar chart with teams as x axis and likelyhood to be hit on y axis

3. Correlation between salary and strikeouts to see if pitchers with higher strikeouts get paid more grouping by league
  a. Violin plot x_axis:strikeouts rounded to nearest 10, y_axis:salaries, hue:league_ids

4. Use a Naive Bayes classifier to look at regular season batting data and hall of fame induction data to predict given a player's statistics
    whether or not they will be inducted into the hall of fame
  a. Make small interface for cmd to analyze stats and make predictions
